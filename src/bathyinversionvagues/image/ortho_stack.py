    characteristics :

    - all the frames are orthorectified in the same cartographic system
    - they have been acquired by the same sensor, almost at the time. The maximum delay between the
      first and the last acquisition is typically of few minutes.
    - they have the same footprint as well as the same resolution
    - thus they have the same size in pixels
    - the frames can be located in a single file or in several distinct files, possibly spread in
      different locations.
    - when several images are contained in a product or in a directory not all of them are
      considered as frames of the OrthoStack. Just a subset of them are declared as frames, which
      allows for instance to select images of the same resolution from the set of images.
